    "1. Submit both a notebook and exported PDF of the notebook after restart-and-run-all.  \n",
    "    1. Submitted notebook must run in reasonable time.\n",
    "    1. Ensure the exported pdf is LaTex formatted. \n",
    "1. For the written section:\n",
    "    1. Output should be listed in a separate, typeset PDF with your ID number.\n",
    "    1. Question numbers are from *The Algorithm Design Manual*, 2nd edition by Steven Skiena.\n",
    "    1. Incomplete solutions recieve no credit. \n",

    "    1. Limit code answers to the designated spaces in functions (marked off by \"###\") and cells (marked by \"### DO: *\\<instructions\\>*\").  \n",
    "       You may add extra cells to run subroutines (in order), but only marked cells will be graded. \n",

    "- You are encouraged to work either alone or with your official partner, but not more.  \n",
    "- For the coding section, test and sanity-check your work extensively.  \n",
    "- For written questions on the coding exercises, if you really understand the solution, the answer should fit in 1-3 sentences.  "
