    "We’ll spend a few extra sessions on Dynamic Programming because:\n",
    "1. It is much more about methodology and design than adapting \"standard\" algorithms.  \n",
    "1. It is both powerful and flexible, so there are a lot of places to apply it.  \n",
    "1. Historically, there has been a steep initial learning curve. \n",
    "1. It shows up in a LOT of job interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the last point, I will clarify that it is entirely possible you will take a job with programming and *never* use dynamic programming.  \n",
    "You *might* if you go to a big tech company, do operations research, or something similar.  \n",
    "But it shows up in technical interviews, particularly for top-level jobs, because it's a very good litmus test.  \n",
    "If you understand dynamic programming, you almost certainly know all of data structures and algorithms and (more importantly) how to apply them to a job.  "

    "# Overview of Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that greedy searches focus on making the best local choice at each decision point.  \n",
    "Such algorithms (like Dijkstra's algorithm) only work if the solution space is special.  \n",
    "We said that it is like having no local minima to get trapped in.  \n",
    "More accurately, it depends on a problem having 2 properties. \n",
    "1. *Greedy-choice property:* Choosing the best (local) option at each step will lead to the best overall solution.\n",
    "1. *Optimal substructure:* The optimal solution to the main problem is made of optimal solutions to smaller sub-problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when a problem exhibits greedy-choice, it exhibits optimal substructure (though it doesn't have to e.g. finding the maximum of a set).  \n",
    "But conversely, problems with optimal substructure do not always exhibit greedy choice.  \n",
    "So barring formal proof for any given problem, greedy algorithms are unlikely to be optimal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Exhaustive searches just look at every possible solution with brute force (and occasional tricks like pruning).  \n",
    "These are guaranteed to work at finding the optimal solution, if they run.  \n",
    "The problem with these is that depending on the problem, they may be slow or implausible to run in reasonable time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic programming** is somewhere in between the two.  \n",
    "It is fundamentally an exhaustive search, so it is going to give the best result (if it runs in finite time).  \n",
    "But it is applied to problems that have optimal substructure, i.e. without greedy-choice.  \n",
    "There is one other requirement for it which is that the problem has *overlapping sub-problems*.  \n",
    "In short, when a problem is broken up into sub-problems, the answers to the subproblems are reused several times.  \n",
    "For problems with optimal substructure, but non-overlapping subproblems, you would reach for divide-and-conquer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen a few dynamic programming algorithms in the portions of graphs, so I will give the high-level idea of generic dynamic programming.  \n",
    "1. Express the problem as a recursive one.\n",
    "1. Identify the base cases, and determine the order in which to solve the higher subproblems.\n",
    "1. Solve the subproblems in order, storing some intermediate results if they are used in higher subproblems. \n",

    "# Example: Fibonacci Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Fibonacci sequence* is a sequence of numbers defined by the recursive relationship $$F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$$ where the sequence starts at $F(1) = 1$ and either $F(0) = 0$ or $F(0) = 1$ depending on who you ask.  \n",
    "For the work below, I will pick the convention $F(0) = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Naive Recursion \n",
    "\n",
    "This is simple enough to code up as a doubly-recursive function, shown in the demo code below.  \n",
    "It clearly works, though it is incredibly slow and inefficient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/19-20_Fn.png\" style=\"width: 50em\" />  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, calculating both $F(6)$ and $F(5)$ will explicitly require $F(4)$.  \n",
    "But neither function call will know if one of them has already found $F(4)$, as the function calls (on a stack) will be on different branches of the DAG.  \n",
    "Propagated to the base cases, the naive version will calculate $F(1)$, and $F(0)$, over and over again.  \n",
    "These base cases (leaf nodes) have value 1, and the ratio of consecutive numbers in the sequence is asymptotically the golden ratio $\\phi$ $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\dfrac{F(n+1)}{F(n)} = \\phi \\approx 1.6$$  \n",
    "Thus the time complexity (read: number of leaf nodes) is roughly $O(1.6^{n})$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As reflected in the demo code, the naive recursive approach is fine for most low values.  \n",
    "But due to the exponential scaling behavior, it starts to rapidly struggle around $n\\approx 30$.  \n",
    "You can also verify for yourself that the ratio of subsequent times is $\\approx 1.6$, at least at high $n$.  \n",
    "Even if you're willing to wait a while, remember there is some max stack limit for Python, so this will definitely fail at high enough $n$. "

    "But the Fibonacci numbers are generated using only values up to 2 positions away.  \n",
    "So we can safely drop to a size-2 cache array by just storing the last 2 calculated values ($O(1)$ in space). \n",

    "## Formulating Recurrences \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: dynamic programming is applicable when the problem has overlapping sub-problems.  \n",
    "That overlap **is** a recurrence relation, and knowing how to express it explicitly and mathematically is how you start hunting out inefficiencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, you will at some point probably need to make/derive a recurrence relation on your own.  \n",
    "For the Fibonacci numbers, the sequence is defined by the relation, so that much is taken care of.  \n",
    "But for calculating binomial coefficients, we used Pascal's rule - what if we didn't know it existed?  \n",
    "What if you're working on a problem no one's done before (or at least one highly specific to your job) and *no one* has found a relation? \n",
    "\n",
    "At some point, finding and exploiting recurrence relations for coding a dynamic programming strategy can become instinctual.  \n",
    "It just requires a lot of practice (which I personally do not posses any more).  \n",
    "Until then, I have 2 general strategies for finding them:\n",
    "- Brute force \\& ignorance \n",
    "- Induction \n",
    "\n",
    "### Brute Force \\& Ignorance\n",
    "This approach is pretty simple:  \n",
    "1. Manually solve (smaller versions of) the problem.  \n",
    "1. List out all the intermediate calculations as a table or tree.  \n",
    "1. Look at the table/tree until you notice a pattern or spot to optimize.\n",
    "1. Test your pattern/optimization, and rationalize it in hindsight.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is definitely the slower method, and it may not even work depending on your current skill level.  \n",
    "But I do genuinely recommend you do this every now and then to develop your instincts in the long term, especially for very unfamiliar problems.  \n",
    "If nothing else, it at least forces you to think about the problem for longer, which is where a lot of breakthroughs happen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Induction\n",
    "The other, more structured approach, is similar to the proof strategy:  \n",
    "1. Find the base cases. \n",
    "1. For a sub-problem of index or size $i$, relate it to the case $i\\pm1$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider calculating the binomial coefficients.  \n",
    "Binomial coefficients $\\binom{n}{k}$ are the number of to find ways to choose (unordered) sets of $k$ items from $n$ options.  \n",
    "So we can identify the 2 base cases as\n",
    "- $(k=0 ,\\quad \\forall n)$ : only one way to pick nothing.\n",
    "- $(k=n ,\\quad \\forall n)$ : only one way to pick everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the inductive step: we want to relate a case of some size to a marginally smaller or larger one.  \n",
    "Here we ultimately want to calculate $\\binom{n}{k}$, and we know the base cases are $k=0$ and $k=n$.  \n",
    "It stands to reason we should try to get a relation that brings us closer to the base cases, i.e. relate $\\binom{n}{k}$ to smaller values of $n$ and $k$.  \n",
    "Now we have a choice of which variable to decrease in order to make the relation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For Pascal's rule, we try relating the cases $n \\rightarrow n-1$, leaving $k$ alone for now.  \n",
    "This has a [combinatorial interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_rule#Combinatorial_proof).  \n",
    "If one were to choose $k$ items from $n$ options, then (strictly) either all $k$ items are from a subset of size $n-1$ or only $k-1$ are from that subset.  \n",
    "The number of ways for the former to occur is $\\binom{n-1}{k}$, while for the latter it is $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}$.  \n",
    "So adding them up will make $\\binom{n}{k}$ and Pascal's rule is recovered.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/19-20_pr.png\" style=\"width: 30em\" />  \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we could leave $n$ alone and change $k$.  \n",
    "This is harder to draw because values increase/decrease depending on the position in triangle.   \n",
    "But you can always fall back on the factorial definition of the coefficients, at which point wrangling into the desired form should give the relation. \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\binom{n}{k} &= \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\\\ \n",
    "&= \\dfrac{n!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!}\\times \\left[\\dfrac{1}{k}\\right]\\\\ \n",
    "&= \\dfrac{n!}{(k-1)!(n-k+1)!}\\times \\left[\\dfrac{n-k+1}{k}\\right]\\\\ \n",
    "&= \\dfrac{n!}{(k-1)!(n-(k-1))!}\\times \\left[\\dfrac{n-k+1}{k}\\right]\\\\ \n",
    "&= \\binom{n}{k-1}\\times \\left[\\dfrac{n-k+1}{k}\\right]\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "So this would give a different yet equally valid relationship.    \n",
    "If you went in the other direction to relate to $k+1$, you should get a similar propotionality.  "

    "# Approximate String Matching \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, from the section on hashing, that a common problem is matching strings and substrings. \n",
    "In that case, we needed to find an exact match in order for the method to work.  \n",
    "In practice, there may be typos (when you fat-finger the keyboard) or misspellings (intentional or otherwise).  \n",
    "Or, some words may only be vaguely similar but convey the same meaning (e.g. “y’all” vs “yinz”).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Edit Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle inexact matches, we need a metric (read: disance) of dissimilarity between strings.  \n",
    "First we need to lay out the operations available to edit a string into greater/lesser similarity with another.  \n",
    "The $3$ options we will consider are:  \n",
    "- **Substitution** – Change a single character to a different character.  \n",
    "Ex. \"hour\" to \"pour\"\n",
    "- **Insertion** – Insert a single character at any position.  \n",
    "Ex. \"our\" to \"pour\"\n",
    "- **Deletion** – Delete a single character at any position.  \n",
    "Ex. \"hour\" to \"our\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If each operation is assigned a penalty/distance of $1$, their sum makes the **(Levenshtein) edit distance**.  \n",
    "For example, \"stop\" and \"start\" has an edit distance of $3$ between them\n",
    "1. Delete the last \"t\" from \"start\" $\\rightarrow$ \"star\".\n",
    "1. Substitute \"p\" for \"r\" in \"star\" $\\rightarrow$ \"stap\".\n",
    "1. Substitute \"o\" for \"a\" in \"stap\" $\\rightarrow$ \"stop\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly we can insert and delete any character over and over to artificially inflate the distance.  \n",
    "So when we refer to the edit distance, we generally mean the smallest possible value it can take.   \n",
    "This is not the only way to assign distances, and you may explore some variations later, but it is the simplest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naive Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually calculate this edit distance, consider the ending character of both strings and check if it they match or not.    \n",
    "If they are matched, we don't need to edit it and can move on to the other characters (contribution of $0$ to the edit distance). \n",
    "When they are not matched, the appropriate edit will depend on all the characters before it, the \"prefix\" of this character. \n",
    "If we knew the best prefix, we can pick option that minimizes the distance for this character.  \n",
    "As with Dijkstra’s algorithm, this suggests a recursive approach.  \n",
    "1. For matched characters, they do not contribute to edit distance and can be ignored.  \n",
    "1. For unmatched characters, test all 3 edit options to match the last character.  \n",
    "1. To get the correct option, recur on the prefix to get its edit distance, then take minimum.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Below I have some demo code for this, comparing 2 totally dissimilar strings of equal length.  \n",
    "You'll immediately notice that it is hopelessly slow beyond strings of length 10.  \n",
    "Again, the naive version doesn't share calculations so go as an exponential of branching factor ($=3$).  \n",
    "We already had issues with branching factors of $1.6$ and  $2$, so it's no surprise this one is as slow as it is.  "

    "## Tabulation: Prefix Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is a good approach here because: \n",
    "1. As soon as a correct edit is made, we never want to revisit it.  \n",
    "1. Many proposed edits are shared in the search tree.  \n",
    "In fact, substitution (a 1-distance edit) is degenerate with deletion followed by insertion of a character (a 2-distance edit).  \n",
    "\n",
    "First we should pick a convenient representation for the storage (cache or table). \n",
    "The most natural approach is tabulation/bottom-up approach because\n",
    "1. We know the base cases (empty prefix)\n",
    "1. It's easier to think about the effect of changing a character on smaller prefixes.  \n",
    "These suggest storing results in a (prefix) distance matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the slides, we construct one manually just to drill in the idea, but it can also be done theoretically by translating the recursive updates.   \n",
    "- The matrix is an $(n+1) \\times (m+1)$ matrix, whose rows and columns correspond to prefixes of increasing length.   \n",
    "- The first row and column contain the base cases (the empty prefix), so they are filled linearly increasing.  \n",
    "- Per unfilled position, check the ending characters of the prefixes.\n",
    "    - If matched, the distance is exactly that of the prefixes one size smaller, i.e. the element directly north-west of it.\n",
    "    - If mismatched, the distance is $1 + \\text{min}(\\text{<3 options>})$.  \n",
    "      The $+1$ is for the corresponding edit one needs to do.  \n",
    "      The 3 options are the 3 ways to approach the current position from smaller prefixes: direct north, direct west, or direct north-west.\n",
    "- The final edit distance is the bottom right-most element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I have some demo code to implement this approach.  \n",
    "We use a `for`-loop to fill all entries of the matrix, top-to-bottom and left-to-right.   \n",
    "Per matrix position `(i, j)`, run an `IF`-statement to check if the end characters match.   \n",
    "If matched, copy the value in position `(i-1, j-1)`.  \n",
    "Otherwise, take $1+$ minimum of values in positions `[(i-1, j-1), (i, j-1), (i-1, j)]`.  \n",
    "Since every item is obtained by arithmetic (which is $O(1)$) once, and there are $mn$ of them, this should run in $O(mn)$ time.  \n",
    " \n",
    "Again, there are some optimizations or alternatives you could do.  \n",
    "Some options for you to explore:\n",
    "- Could use a top-down approach, as in the Fibonacci problem\n",
    "- Can optimize space usage by only storing the previous row/column, since only the adjacent row/column is used in calculating entries.\n",
    "- Most of the table entries have absolutely nothing to do with the ultimate path, so you can try to ignore those.  \n"

    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the start, dynamic programming is more about methodology than standard solutions.   \n",
    "That's not to say there *aren't* standard problems, there definitely are.  \n",
    "[Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-dynamic-programming-interview-questions/) is a list of 20 that might come up in a job interview.  \n",
    "Some notable ones:\n",
    "- Knapsack Problem\n",
    "- Rod Cutting Problem\n",
    "- Coin Change Problem\t\n",
    "- Partition Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "What I am saying is that it is largely impractical to just memorize solutions to all 20 of them, which is probably only scratching the surface anyway.  \n",
    "It is certainly impractical for me to lecture on all of them (we don't have that kind of time).  \n",
    "Furthermore, most technical interviews probably aren't going to ask these problems exactly - they'll tweak it in some ways that need adaptation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But if you can do at least some of these problems on your own, from scratch, you are much more likely to solve *any* of them.  \n",
    "The ultimate goal is to build up a your base ability so that, even if you don't train for it exactly, you can still solve a generic problem.  \n",
    "When you get to the stretch before a technical interview, *then* you can go wild and memorize as much as you want to squeeze out the last bits of performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, this will be the last planned lecture notebook; there should still be some slides for the last topic.  \n",
    "The next sessions will mostly be exercises.  \n",
    "I will give the outline of some of the dynamic programming problems above.  \n",
    "Your goal will be to solve it with as little intervention as possible.  \n",
    "And just to clarify, these in-class exercises will **not** be graded, these are purely for your learning.  \n",
    "Personally, I would recommend making a notebook or report per problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I have also reserved some problems that don't really fit in with the practice problems.  \n",
    "These require a bit more independent work, and additional time to understand.  \n",
    "If you wish to attempt these, notify me and I will assign one to you.  \n",
    "The output is a report, and the reward is an oral exam.  "
