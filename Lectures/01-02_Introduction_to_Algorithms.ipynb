    "# Introduction to Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "An **algorithm** is, at heart, a set of instructions to complete a task.  \n",
    "More specifically, algorithms are a set of specific instructions that take a clear input, and return a well-defined output in finite time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The latter half distinguishes algorithms from *heuristics.*  \n",
    "Heuristics are also instructions, but they are not generally guaranteed to give correct/optimal results, or quantifiable expectation of performance.  \n",
    "In fact, the book gives a few examples where heuristics fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems Solved by Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [many algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms) that have been developed over the years to solve myriad problems, enough that one could compile a \"cookbook\" of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some notable ones:\n",
    "- Sorting\n",
    "- Route Optimization\n",
    "- Matrix Manipulations\n",
    "- Fast Fourier Tranforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Common to all of them is specificity.  \n",
    "An algorithm must follow the same guidelines, and use the same steps to accomplish the task for any valid input.  \n",
    "It does not \"improvise\" mid-execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note this class is not a cookbook class.  \n",
    "We will go over some of the major algorithms, and leave out many others.  \n",
    "The goal is to impart some idea of how to design algorithms yourself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating Algorithms \n",
    "\n",
    "There's more than one way to skin a cat (though I don't know why you would).  \n",
    "Similarly, there is more than one algorithm to solve any given problem, and as you'll see later some are not ideal.  \n",
    "Evaluating which algorithm to use can save you a lot of time and grief.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms can be evaluated either before implementation (*a priori*) or after (*a posterior*), and evaluated for 2 qualities:  correctness and efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is: \n",
    "- **functionally correct** if, for all possible inputs, the desired output will be successfully returned. \n",
    "- **partially correct** if, assuming an output is returned, the output is correct. \n",
    "- **totally correct** if the desired output is always returned in finite time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect** algorithms either return incorrect output for at least one legal input, or fail to return an output at all and just run endlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Showing an algorithm is correct (in any sense) is not, in general, a trivial exercise.  \n",
    "You could do it in a purely *a posteriori* manner by exhaustively checking that every input maps to the correct output.  \n",
    "But that would both defeat the purpose of having an algorithm in the first place, and be extremely time-consuming.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So you will need at least some theoretical understanding of why the algorithm should be correct.  \n",
    "Formally, this refers to a mathematical proof.  \n",
    "We are not going to rely that heavily on these, as we do not have a full proofs-course on offer.  \n",
    "Furthermore, I would like to develop your instincts for algorithms, as they are mostly transferrable to other endeavors (e.g. debugging).  \n",
    "\n",
    "With all that said, consider the following concepts when evaluating algorithms: \n",
    "- **Not-incorrectness**: \n",
    "Rather than thinking of why the algorithm is correct (for every input), it's worth thinking about if it's incorrect (at least once).  \n",
    "If you can quickly find a case where an algorithm fails, you save yourself a lot of time defending the algorithm.  \n",
    "Plus, you have a hook into figuring out specifically *why* the algorithm is incorrect.  \n",
    "The key of course is that you should find it as quickly as possible.  \n",
    "This comes with practice, but the book (1.3.3) does go through some common guides like \"think small,\" and \"check extreme values.\"  \n",
    "- **Logical Continuity (Induction/Recursion)**: \n",
    "Failing to find an incorrect case is encouraging, but not the same as proving correctness.  \n",
    "Put another way, showing the algorithm is correct in a few test cases does not prove it is true for all cases.  \n",
    "This is because all the cases are treated as stand-alone.  \n",
    "You cannot determine the behavior of the *space* of inputs-outputs with *points* in the space alone (you need curves at least).  \n",
    "To fill in the gaps, you need to relate one case to another.  \n",
    "*Induction* is proving that, if something is true in one case, it must also be true for a related case.  \n",
    "As long as you can prove this property, and show one specific case that is correct (the *base case*), you can work your way through the space of inputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency refers to the amount of resources required for the algorithm to execute, as a function of problem size $n$.  \n",
    "\"Resources\" in this case typically refers to 2 values:  \n",
    "- Time: how long does it take for the algorithm to run .\n",
    "- Space: how much memory does it take for the algorithm to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "As techonology becomes more powerful, it is tempting to simply \"throw more computer\" at problems to solve them.  \n",
    "Fight this urge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For one, there are some problems where brute-force (exhaustive) searching would be implausible.  \n",
    "As an example, tic-tac-toe can be brute-force solved because it does not have many unique game states (138 total, 14 ending states).  \n",
    "But there are around $10^{120}$ possible chess games (for reference, the universe is only about $10^{17}$ second old), so it cannot be brute-forced in reasonable time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For another, time is money.  \n",
    "So is computer memory.  \n",
    "Developing an algorithm allows you to solve problems faster and with fewer resources, which lets you scale things up better.  \n",
    "In practice, it usually doesn't take that large of a problem for an efficient algorithm on a slow system to beat inefficient algorithms on fast systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about asymptotic behavior next, but for now let's say some algorithms scale with the size of the problem $n$.  \n",
    "If one of the algorithms runs in $\\propto n$ time steps, and the other in $\\propto n^2$, the former will be faster for large enough applications (regardless of the coefficients).  \n",
    "This is because $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{c_1n}{c_2n^2} = 0 \\quad \\forall \\{c_1 > 0, c_2 > 0\\}$$  \n",
    "The code below is a numerical illustration, but you can play around with the numbers and scaling behavior to explore.  "

    "In this model, the algorithm runs on a generic \"[computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)\" that has \n",

    "Each step of an algorithm is a *primitive operation* that: \n",
    "- Acts on any memory block\n",
    "- Cannot be reduced to simpler sub-steps, and \n",
    "- Theoretically takes 1 step of time to execute.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On any given system and any given implementation, step $i$ may execute faster or slower than this, so the actual time cost is denoted $c_i$.  \n",
    "From this, it is (relatively) straightforward to calculate the runtime per step: it is the number of times the step executes $t_i(n)$ times its cost $c_i$.  \n",
    "The total cost is the sum over all steps of the algorithm.  \n",
    "$$T(n) = \\sum_{i} c_it_{i}(n)$$\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "English: $O(g(n))$ is the set of all functions, $f(n)$, which are always below at least a scaled-version of a bounding function $g(n)$, as long as $n$ is large enough.  \n",

    "Ergo $T(n)$ is in the set $O(n^2)$, which can be written as either: \n",

    "$$T(n)\\in O(n^2)\\quad \\text{OR}\\quad T(n) = O(n^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The former is the actual notation, while the latter is an abuse of notation for composing algorithms together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that bounding functions can also be asymptotically bounded.  \n",
    "For instance, $n^2$ is asymptotically bounded above by $n^3$, which means $O(n^2) \\subset O(n^3)$.  \n",
